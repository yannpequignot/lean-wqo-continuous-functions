## 3. Proof Tree for Main Theorem 3

**Statement** (`MainResults/ScatFunBQO.lean`):

> **Theorem 3 (WQO).** Continuous reducibility is a well-quasi-order on
> `ScatFun` — scattered continuous functions from subsets of Baire space to Baire space.

```

  ↓ via TwoBQO.wellQuasiOrdered

  ↓ via TwoBQO.iff_noBad
¬ ∃ bad pair-sequence in (ScatFun, ScatFun.Reduces)
```

This "no bad sequence" claim is split into two independent pillars:

### Pillar A — Concentration on a single CB-rank level

        Uses Ordinal.leBullet.isTwoBQO: (Ordinal.{0}, ≤•) is 2-BQO     [PROVED ✓]
```

### Pillar B — No bad sequence at any single CB-rank level

```
ScatFun.no_bad_all_levels                                     [PROVED ✓, uses sorry below]
  "∀ β < ω₁, the level ScatFun.Level β has no bad pair-sequence"
  ↓ by transfinite induction on β

  "If all levels < β are 2-BQO, then level β is 2-BQO"
  │
  This is the key missing step. The intended mathematical proof is:
  │
  ├── Finite Generation Theorem (PreciseStructure/Theorems.lean)  [SORRY]

  │      finite gluing of finitely many generators (MaxFun and centered functions)"

## 4. Key Definitions

### Continuous reducibility

```lean
-- f : A → B reduces to g : C → D if there exist continuous σ : A → C and
-- τ : range(g ∘ σ) → B with f = τ ∘ g ∘ σ on the appropriate subsets.
def ContinuouslyReduces (f : A → B) (g : C → D) : Prop := ...
```

### Scattered functions and CB rank

```lean
-- f is scattered if every nonempty set has a piece on which f is constant.
def ScatteredFun (f : A → B) : Prop := ...

-- Cantor–Bendixson derivative: transfinite sequence of sets
noncomputable def CBLevel (f : A → B) : Ordinal → Set A := ...

-- CB rank: first ordinal where the derivative empties out
noncomputable def CBRank (f : A → B) : Ordinal := ...
```

### ScatFun (the 2-BQO universe)

```lean
-- A scattered continuous function on (subsets of) Baire space ℕ → ℕ.
structure ScatFun where
  domain : Set Baire
  func   : ↑domain → Baire
  hScat  : ScatteredFun func
  hCont  : Continuous func

-- Level-β fragment: functions with CB rank exactly β.
def ScatFun.Level (β : Ordinal) : Type := { F : ScatFun // CBRank F.func = β }
```

### Pointed gluing

```lean
-- PointedGluingSet Aᵢ = {0^ω} ∪ ⋃ᵢ (0^i)(1) · Aᵢ
def PointedGluingSet (A : ℕ → Set (ℕ → ℕ)) : Set (ℕ → ℕ) := ...

-- PointedGluingFun: maps (0^i)(1)·x to (0^i)(1)·fᵢ(x) and 0^ω to 0^ω.
noncomputable def PointedGluingFun (...) : PointedGluingSet A → ℕ → ℕ := ...

-- MaxFun(α) and MinFun(α): the maximum and minimum scattered functions at CB rank α.
noncomputable def MaxFun : Ordinal → (MaxDom α → ℕ → ℕ) := ...
noncomputable def MinFun : Ordinal → (MinDom α → ℕ → ℕ) := ...
```

### 2-BQO

```lean

## 5. The Road Ahead

The single blocking sorry for Main Theorem 3 is:

```lean
theorem ScatFun.Level.no_bad (β : Ordinal) (hβ : β < omega1)
    (ih : ∀ γ < β, ¬ ∃ bad in Level γ) :
    ¬ ∃ bad in Level β := by
  sorry
```

Filling this requires three chapters of mathematical work:

1. **Centered functions** (`CenteredFunctions/Theorems.lean`):
   - `IsCentered f`: the function `f` is centered — it is a pointed gluing of its ray functions.
   - Key theorems to prove: `centeredSuccessor` (centered functions at successor ranks are
     gluings of centered functions at lower ranks), `simpleFunctionsLambdaPlusOne`
     (classification of simple functions at level λ+1).

2. **Precise Structure Theorem** (`PreciseStructure/Theorems.lean`):
   - Every function at level β is continuously equivalent to a finite gluing of
     `MaxFun(β)` and finitely many "centered" generator functions.
   - This requires the double-successor case (`DoubleSuccessor/Theorems.lean`):
     the vertical and diagonal theorems showing that functions at level α+2 decompose
     via a "gobbling" argument.

3. **From finite generation to BQO** (`ScatFun/ReflectLevel.lean`):
   - Once Level β is finitely generated, `Level β` injects into a finite product
     of 2-BQOs (the generators at lower levels, which are 2-BQO by induction).
   - `TwoBQO.prod` (Dickson's lemma) then gives the 2-BQO conclusion.
